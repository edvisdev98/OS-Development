## 🧰 Required Tools

Before getting started, please download and install the following tools:

- **NASM** – Assembler used to compile `.asm` files into bootable `.img` files.
- **QEMU** – Virtual machine emulator for testing and running your custom bootloader.

> **Note:** After installing the tools, make sure to add them to your system environment variables so you can run them from any terminal or command prompt.

## 📁 Example Files

Inside the `Examples/` folder, you will find bootloader examples:

---

### 🔹 HelloWorld.asm
- Prints **"Hello World!"** to the screen.
- Includes beginner-friendly comments to help you understand the code.

---

### 🔹 PrintCharacters.asm
- Prints characters from **A-Z, a-z, and 0-9** using BIOS interrupts.

---

### 🔹 CheckRAM.asm
- Checks and displays RAM size up to **1 MB** (typically around 640 KB).

---

### 🔹 ClearScreen.asm
- Clears the entire **text-mode screen** by filling it with blank spaces and a specified color attribute.
- Resets the cursor position to the **top-left corner** (row 0, column 0).
- Uses **direct video memory access** and BIOS interrupts to manipulate the screen and cursor.

---

### 🔹 BackgroundColor.asm
- Changes the **background color** of the entire text-mode screen.
- Directly writes blank spaces with the specified background color attribute into video memory.

---

### 🔹 TextFontColor.asm
- Changes the **text (foreground) color** displayed on the screen while leaving the background color unchanged.

> **Note:** `VGA Color Codes for Text Mode.jpg` includes a table listing HEX color codes for use with `BackgroundColor.asm` and `TextFontColor.asm`.

## ⚙️ Compilation & Testing

### ✅ To Compile a Bootloader 
Use NASM to assemble the `.asm` file into a raw binary `.img`:

```bash
nasm -f bin <filename>.asm -o <filename>.img

#### ✅ To Run the Bootloader in QEMU
Use QEMU to boot and test your `.img` file:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -fda <filename>.img
