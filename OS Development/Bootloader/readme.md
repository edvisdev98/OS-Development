OS Development Dev Kit

Made by EdvinasDev_98, 2025

Project files are open-sourced. Please feel free to use them.

Required Tools:
    Before getting started, please download and install the following tools:

    NASM - Assembler used to compile .asm files into bootable .img files.

    QEMU - Virtual machine emulator for testing and running your custom bootloader.

    Note: After installing the tools, make sure to add them to your system environment variables so you can run them from any terminal or command prompt.

Example Files:
    Inside the Examples/ folder, you will find bootloader examples:

    HelloWorld.asm
    
    Prints "Hello World!" to the screen.
    Includes beginner-friendly comments to help you understand the code.

    PrintCharacters.asm
    
    Prints characters from A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 using BIOS interrupts.

    CheckRAM.asm
    
    Check and display RAM size up to 1 MB (typically around 640 KB).

    ClearScreen.asm

    Clears the entire text-mode screen by filling it with blank spaces and a specified color attribute. Resets the cursor position to the top-left corner (row 0, column 0). Uses direct video memory access and BIOS interrupts to manipulate the screen and cursor.

    BackgroundColor.asm

    Changes the background color of the entire text-mode screen by directly writing blank spaces with the specified background color attribute into video memory.

    TextFontColor.asm

    Changes the color of the text (foreground) displayed on the screen while leaving the background color unchanged.

    (Note: VGA Color Codes for Text Mode.xlsx includes a table listing HEX color codes for use with BackgroundColor.asm and TextFontColor.asm.)

Compilation & Testing:

    To Compile a Bootloader
    Use NASM to assemble the .asm file into a raw binary .img:
    
    nasm -f bin <filename>.asm -o <filename>.img

    To Run the Bootloader in QEMU:
    Use QEMU to boot and test your .img file:
    
    qemu-system-x86_64 -fda <filename>.img

Happy Coding!
This dev kit is designed to help you get started with low-level OS development. Explore, experiment, and have fun creating your own bootloaders and eventually - your own operating system!
